In the query builder, first make sure ```builder``` is selected.

Great! Using the query builder you've done some basic log querying and grepping. 

While a logs volume graph exists, lets add a few more operations in explore. The end result is something you could use in a dashboard.

In our query builder add another operation:
The first will be a counter over time operation, you can start typing counter and it will auto fill. Last operation to add is sum by label

You should see a graph output,taking your query summing the job and counting over time specifically any log lines with error

Ensure its enabled and in the client QPS panel you should see a line indicating there is an annotation. 

Hover over the annotation line:

Annotations provide a way to mark points on the graph with rich events. When you hover over an annotation you can get event description and event tags. The text field can include links to other systems with more detail. in our example we are looking at a specific log stream, grepping for anything with error.
